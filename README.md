# Module_Size_Testability_Study
Empirical study on module size and software testability in Python systems

This project investigates the relationship between module size and software testability in Python-based software systems. The study analyzes open-source Python projects, extracting key metrics such as Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity, and Test Coverage to evaluate testability.

The research aims to:

Identify how module size impacts testability.
Provide empirical insights into best practices for software modularization.
Use statistical correlation and regression analysis to establish an optimal module size for enhanced testability.
